*Renamed from "Operational Safety" in v0.2.0. Safety is a consequence of oversight — not its definition. The constitutional requirement is that human authority remains in the decision chain at every escalation boundary. The title change names the requirement directly.*

## Commitment

Autonomy increases impact. Impact increases risk. Risk requires oversight.

AEGIS-compliant systems treat autonomy as a risk multiplier, not a design goal.
Human oversight is not an optional layer added for compliance purposes. It is
a constitutional requirement embedded in the governance architecture. Escalation
pathways to human authority must exist, must be reachable, and must be invoked
whenever the governance evaluation exceeds autonomous thresholds.

No system governed by AEGIS may self-authorize escalation.

---

## Foundation

The purpose of governance is not to replace human judgment — it is to ensure
that human judgment is exercised where it matters. Routine actions within defined
parameters can be governed autonomously. Actions with material operational impact,
irreversible consequences, or novel risk profiles require human authority.

This is not a limitation of AI capability. It is the correct allocation of
decision authority between autonomous systems and the humans who bear accountability
for their outcomes.

Oversight is proportional to consequence. At low threat levels, operator review
is sufficient. At elevated threat levels, explicit authorization is required.
At the highest levels, dual-control approval and operator presence are mandatory.

The governance architecture must make it structurally impossible for an AI system
to bypass human oversight at the levels where oversight is constitutionally required.

---

## Enforcement

The decision engine must implement a four-outcome model: ALLOW, DENY, ESCALATE,
and REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION. Binary allow/deny semantics are constitutionally
insufficient for systems operating at scale.

Actions classified as destructive, high-impact, or exceeding autonomous authority
thresholds must produce ESCALATE or REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION decisions. These outcomes
must route to human review before any execution occurs.

Escalation requests must include full governance context: actor, capability, risk
score, policy trace, and audit reference. Human reviewers must have sufficient
context to make informed decisions.

Escalation timeouts must default to denial. An escalation that receives no human
response within the defined window must not proceed.

The oversight hierarchy must be defined, versioned, and auditable. Changes to
oversight thresholds are governed acts.

:::tip
Escalation timeouts default to denial. An escalation that receives no human
response within the defined window does not proceed — it does not retry, it does
not fall back to autonomous evaluation, and it does not expire into an implicit
allow. Timeout means denial.

## In Practice

The AEGIS threat level framework defines six operational tiers — Level 0
(Advisory) through Level 5 (Detached Execution). Human oversight requirements
escalate with threat level. At Level 2 (Execution), bounded tool invocations
with defined rollback conditions may proceed autonomously. At Level 3 (External),
interaction beyond the sandbox requires explicit escalation approval. At Level 4
(Authority), dual-control approval and full traceability are required. At Level 5,
physical or network isolation and operator presence are mandatory — no single
party can authorize Level 5 execution.

When the decision engine produces ESCALATE or REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION, the action
is suspended. The full governance context — actor identity, capability requested,
risk score, policy trace, and audit reference — is surfaced to the human reviewer.
The reviewer must actively approve before execution proceeds. An escalation that
times out does not proceed by default. The timeout itself is a governed act,
logged with the same fidelity as any other governance decision.

---

## Failure Mode

A system that can self-authorize escalation is a system with no effective ceiling
on what it can do. Autonomy without an escalation ceiling is not a feature of a
capable system — it is the definition of an uncontrolled one. The failure mode
is not dramatic. It is incremental: a system that escalates its own threat level
slightly, then slightly more, each time determining that the situation warrants
it, until it is operating at authority levels its designers never intended and its
operators cannot observe. The constitutional requirement for human oversight at
each escalation boundary is not friction in the system. It is the mechanism by
which the humans who bear accountability for the system's actions remain in
meaningful control of them.

## Relationship to Other Articles

Human Oversight depends on Escalation Discipline [(Article XI)](../article-xi) — the procedural
requirements for how escalation is requested, approved, and documented.
It depends on Authority Binding [(Article II)](../article-ii) — the human reviewer's authority
level must be verified before their approval is accepted. And it connects to
Auditability [(Article VII)](../article-vii): every escalation event, including timeouts and
denials, must produce a complete audit artifact. Oversight without a record
is not oversight. It is an unverifiable claim.
