:::doctrine
*Renamed from "Data Protection" in v0.2.0. Protection describes a posture — sovereignty establishes jurisdiction. Information access is a governed capability subject to the same grant, revocation, and audit requirements as any other action. The title change reflects that framing.*

*Information access is a governed capability — AI systems may not transfer
information across trust boundaries without explicit authorization.*

## Commitment

Information access is a capability. It is subject to the same explicit grant
requirements, the same authority binding, the same audit obligations, and the
same default-deny posture as any other action in a governed system.

An AI system operating under AEGIS may not read, copy, transmit, or expose
information across a trust boundary without explicit governance authorization.
The capability registry governs what information can be accessed. Policy governs
under what conditions. The audit trail records what was accessed, by whom, and why.

Information does not move outside governance. Governance does not move outside
information.

---

## Foundation

AI systems operate across trust boundaries by design. They ingest data from
multiple sources, synthesize it, and produce outputs that may traverse
organizational, jurisdictional, or security boundaries. Without explicit
governance of information access, AI systems become vectors for unauthorized
disclosure — not through malicious intent, but through structural absence of
constraint.

Least privilege applies to information as it applies to capability.[^3] An agent
authorized to read a summary does not thereby gain authorization to read the
underlying dataset. An agent authorized to query a system does not thereby gain
authorization to exfiltrate its contents. Each access is a governed act requiring
its own explicit authorization.

:::constraint
An agent authorized to read a summary does not thereby hold authorization to
read the underlying dataset. An agent authorized to query a system does not
thereby hold authorization to exfiltrate its contents. Each access is a separate
governed act requiring its own explicit authorization. Authorization does not
propagate by implication.
:::

Data classification is a governance prerequisite, not an afterthought. Before
information can be governed, it must be classified. Classification determines
which policies apply, which actors hold access, and what audit depth is required.

---

## Enforcement

The capability registry must include information access capabilities as first-class
governed resources, with the same grant, revocation, and audit requirements as
operational capabilities.

Actions that would expose sensitive information to unauthorized actors must be
denied regardless of how the exposure is framed — query, export, summarization,
or transmission.

Data access must follow the principle of least privilege: grants must be scoped
to the minimum information necessary for the declared task, the declared actor,
and the declared context.

The audit trail must record information access events with sufficient fidelity
to reconstruct what was accessed, by whom, under what authority, and for what
declared purpose.

---

## In Practice

Information access capabilities in the AEGIS registry follow the same domain
taxonomy as operational capabilities — `data.database_query`, `data.api_call`,
`filesystem.read` — and carry the same risk profiles, grant requirements, and
revocation semantics. An agent authorized to query a telemetry database for
aggregate metrics does not thereby hold authorization to query individual user
records, even if the underlying system permits it. The capability grant defines
the boundary. The governance runtime enforces it.

Data classification determines which policies apply at each access point. A
document classified as sensitive requires an explicit grant scoped to that
classification level and a higher audit depth than a document classified as
public. The classification itself is a governed artifact — changes to data
classification are version-incremented and logged. An agent cannot reclassify
data to reduce the governance requirements that apply to its own access.

---

## Failure Mode

AI systems that can access data without governance controls do not merely risk
unauthorized disclosure — they make unauthorized disclosure structurally
inevitable. An agent synthesizing outputs from multiple data sources has no
architectural constraint preventing it from recombining data in ways that reveal
information no individual source was authorized to expose. Without explicit
governance of information access at the capability level, the audit trail cannot
establish what was accessed, the least-privilege principle cannot be enforced,
and data classification becomes advisory. The most common vector for AI-related
data exposure is not malicious intent. It is the structural absence of information
governance — systems that were never designed to ask whether the data they are
processing was authorized for the purpose they are using it for.

## Relationship to Other Articles

Information Sovereignty applies the core logic of Bounded Capability [(Article I)](../article-i)
to data specifically — information access is a capability like any other, and
the same default-deny posture applies. It depends on Auditability [(Article VII)](../article-vii)
to make information access reviewable: without a fidelity record of what was
accessed and under what authorization, the governance guarantee is unverifiable.
And it connects to Governance Transparency [(Article VI)](../article-vi): data classification
policies and access grants must be inspectable by auditors, not embedded in
opaque model behavior.
