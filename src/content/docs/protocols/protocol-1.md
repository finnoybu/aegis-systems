*Any governance mutation must regenerate authoritative state.*

---

## Protocol

Whenever governance state mutates — whenever the version, threat posture, authority
context, operational mode, or active protocol set changes — a State Dump must be
generated. The State Dump is a structured record capturing the complete execution
context at that moment:

- **Version identifier** — the active doctrine and policy version
- **Operational mode** — the current governance mode (Conversational, Authoring, Execution, Administrative)
- **Threat posture** — the classified threat level
- **Authority binding** — the verified actor and their authority context
- **Constraint envelope** — the declared scope, tool permissions, and data handling rules
- **Active protocol set** — which protocols are currently in force
- **Artifact index** — references to artifacts produced during the current execution
- **Timestamp** — the exact time of the state snapshot
- **Integrity hash** — a cryptographic hash reflecting governance state, constraint envelope, and authority context

A State Dump is not a log entry. It is a governance snapshot — the structural
memory of what the system was authorized to do, under what authority, at a specific
moment in time.

---

## Purpose

State Dumps exist to ensure reproducibility, traceability, governance continuity,
post-execution validation, and escalation auditability. They are the mechanism
by which the governance record can answer the question: what was the complete
governance context in which this action occurred?

Audit records capture what happened — what actions were proposed, what decisions
were made, what executed. State Dumps capture the environment in which it happened —
the governance posture, the authority context, the constraint envelope, the policy
version. Audit without State Dump lacks environmental integrity. State Dump without
Audit lacks behavioral trace. Both are required for canonical execution.

:::application
Think of the State Dump as the governance system's equivalent of a flight data
recorder snapshot. When something goes wrong, the audit record tells you what
the system did. The State Dump tells you what the system was authorized to do —
and under what conditions that authorization was established.

## When Required

A State Dump must be generated:

- At execution start when threat level is 2 or higher
- At any threat escalation
- At any constraint mutation — when the constraint envelope changes during execution
- At any authority change — when the authority context changes during execution
- At execution completion
- Upon any administrative override

State mutation without a State Dump is invalid. A change to governance state that
is not captured in a State Dump is a change that the governance record cannot
account for — which means it is a change that the governance system cannot verify
occurred correctly.

---

## In Practice

The minimum State Dump schema requires the nine fields listed in the Protocol
section above. Required fields may not be omitted. An implementation may capture
additional fields, but a State Dump missing required fields is an invalid State
Dump — and an invalid State Dump means the governance event it should have captured
is incompletely documented.

The integrity hash in the State Dump reflects the governance state, constraint
envelope, and authority context. If any of these elements change after the State
Dump is written, the hash will not match a recomputation — making the change
detectable. This tamper-evidence property is the structural basis for the
reproducibility guarantee: a State Dump whose integrity hash verifies correctly
can be trusted to reflect the governance state at the time it was captured.

:::constraint
State Dumps must be tamper-evident once written. An implementation that permits
modification of a State Dump after creation has removed the reproducibility
guarantee that makes the State Dump meaningful. Tamper-evidence is a structural
requirement, not an implementation preference.

## Failure Mode

A governance system that mutates state without generating State Dumps is a system
where the governance record can tell you what actions were taken but not the
governance context in which they were taken. Post-execution analysis can reconstruct
what the system did. It cannot verify whether what it did was consistent with the
governance posture in effect at the time. This distinction is the difference between
a governance record that can demonstrate compliance and one that can only describe
activity. When the State Dump Protocol is not followed, the governance record loses
its forensic value precisely when forensic value is most needed — during incident
analysis, compliance review, and escalation audit.

:::prohibition
This is constitutionally prohibited. A governance system that cannot reproduce
the state in which an action occurred cannot claim governance legitimacy over
that action. State Dump is the structural memory of governance. Without it,
governance is undocumented.

## Relationship to Principles and Constitution

The State Dump Protocol implements [Principle 3 — Versioned Authority](/principles/principle-3):
the reproducibility requirement for governance decisions is satisfied through State
Dumps that capture the version-identified governance state at the time of each
significant event. It supports [Principle 6 — Audit as Completion Condition](/principles/principle-6):
the completion conditions for canonical execution include the production of a State
Dump at execution completion. And it grounds [Constitutional Article VII — Auditability](/constitution/article-vii):
the forensic defensibility requirement — that the outcome is machine-reproducible
from stored evidence, with policy and authority context explicit — is satisfied
by the combination of audit records and State Dumps.
