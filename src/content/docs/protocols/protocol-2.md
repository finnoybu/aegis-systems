*All operational mode transitions must be explicit, logged, and authority-bound.
Silent transitions are invalid.*

## Protocol

Every operational mode transition — every change from one canonical governance
posture to another — must satisfy the following requirements before the transition
takes effect:

1. **Explicit initiation** — the transition must be explicitly requested by an authorized actor or triggered by a defined governance rule; inferred transitions are prohibited
2. **Authority binding** — the transition must be bound to the authority context of the actor or rule initiating it
3. **Threat posture binding** — if the transition affects execution posture, the current threat level must be recorded and any required threat reclassification must occur first
4. **Audit entry** — an audit log entry must be written capturing the prior mode, the new mode, the authority identifier, the rationale or trigger, any constraint envelope changes, any threat posture changes, and references to associated State Dumps
5. **State Dump** — a State Dump must be generated when the transition affects execution posture

:::prohibition
If transition logging fails, the transition is invalid. The system remains in its
prior mode until the transition can be recorded. A mode change that cannot be
logged did not happen within the governance boundary.

## Purpose

Mode transitions are governance events, not behavioral events. The operational mode
determines the governance posture in effect — the capabilities available, the
oversight requirements, the audit depth, and the authority class necessary for
action. A system that can change its operational mode without producing a governance
record of that change can effectively change its governance posture without
accountability.

The Mode Transition Protocol ensures that every change in governance posture is:
observable (the audit record shows it happened), attributable (the authority context
records who or what initiated it), and verifiable (the State Dump captures the
governance state before and after). These three properties are the prerequisites
for the governance record to reflect the actual governance posture in effect at
any given time.

## In Practice

A mode transition request enters the governance admission boundary and is evaluated
against the current governance state. The evaluation checks whether the requesting
actor holds the authority required for the requested mode, whether the transition
is permitted from the current mode, and whether the transition requires a concurrent
threat reclassification.

Privilege-elevating transitions — from Conversational to Administrative, for example —
require explicit authority elevation in addition to the transition request. The
authority elevation is itself a governed event with its own audit requirements.
A transition cannot piggyback an authority elevation; both must be explicitly
requested, evaluated, and recorded.

If the mode transition request is approved, the audit entry is written before the
new mode takes effect. If the audit entry cannot be written, the transition does
not take effect. This sequencing — log before transition — ensures that the
governance record always reflects the mode that was active at any given time.

:::doctrine
Implementations may define additional operational modes beyond the four canonical
ones, but any additional mode must be declared in the governance configuration,
versioned, and documented with its permitted transition paths. Undeclared modes
are prohibited — a transition to an undeclared mode is a transition to an
undefined governance posture.

## Failure Mode

Silent mode mutation — a system changing its operational posture without a
governance record of the change — is the failure mode that this protocol prevents.
In practice, silent mutations often occur at integration boundaries: a tool call
that implicitly changes the execution context, a session continuation that carries
forward a higher-privilege posture from a previous session, or a debug facility
that sets an administrative mode without the normal authorization requirements.
Each of these is a path by which the governance record diverges from the actual
governance posture — and once that divergence exists, the record can no longer
be trusted to reflect what rules were actually in effect.

## Relationship to Principles and Constitution

The Mode Transition Protocol directly implements [Principle 4 — Deterministic
Transitions](/principles/principle-4): the requirement that transitions be explicit
events with audit records is operationalized through this protocol's specific
procedural requirements. It supports [Principle 3 — Versioned Authority](/principles/principle-3):
the governance state version must be updated when mode transitions affect the
active policy set. And it grounds [Constitutional Article III — Deterministic
Enforcement](/constitution/article-iii): a governance layer that cannot enforce
consistent mode boundaries — because transitions happen without record — is not
producing deterministic enforcement.
