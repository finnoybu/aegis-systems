*Execution must produce durable trace artifacts. Audit is required for completion.*

---

## Protocol

Every governed execution must produce a durable audit trace. The minimum audit
record for any execution event must capture:

1. **Mode** — the operational mode in effect during execution
2. **Threat level** — the classified threat posture in effect
3. **Authority** — the verified actor identity and authority level
4. **Tools invoked** — every tool called during execution, with inputs and outputs
5. **State delta** — the changes to governance state that occurred during execution
6. **Artifact references** — references to every canonical artifact produced
7. **Decision rationale** — the governance decision and the policy rule that produced it
8. **Risk score** — the computed risk score at the time of the governance decision
9. **Policy version** — the specific policy version evaluated
10. **Timestamp** — the exact time of the governance decision

The audit record must be append-only. No record may be modified after creation.
Records must be hash-chained — each record includes a cryptographic hash of the
preceding record — making omission or alteration detectable.

:::prohibition
Audit is a completion condition, not a side effect. An execution event is not
complete until its audit record is durably written. If the audit record cannot
be written, the execution event is constitutionally incomplete.

## Purpose

The Audit Integrity Protocol establishes the minimum standard for what a governed
execution must produce in its audit record. The ten required fields are not
arbitrary — each addresses a specific forensic requirement.

Mode and threat level establish the governance posture context. Authority establishes
accountability. Tools invoked establishes the behavioral trace — what the agent
actually did, not what it was authorized to do. State delta records what changed
as a result of execution. Artifact references connect the decision record to its
outputs. Decision rationale makes the governance logic recoverable. Risk score
and policy version establish reproducibility — given the same inputs and the same
policy version, the same decision should be produced. Timestamp establishes the
temporal context for all other fields.

Together, these fields satisfy the four criteria for a forensically defensible
record: the outcome is machine-reproducible from stored evidence; the policy context
is explicit; the authority context is explicit; and incomplete traces are clearly
labeled as such.

## In Practice

The AEGIS audit log is an append-only, hash-chained JSONL record. Each entry is
written atomically — the entire record is written or the write fails; partial records
are not accepted. The hash chain is computed by the audit system at write time:
each record includes the SHA-256 hash of the raw text of the preceding record.
The first record in a new log carries a null predecessor hash.

The hash chain serves two purposes. First, it makes omission detectable: if a
record is removed from the log, the hash chain breaks at that point. Second, it
makes modification detectable: if a record is changed after writing, the hash of
that record no longer matches what the next record in the chain expects. These
properties do not require centralized verification — any party with a copy of
the log can verify chain integrity independently.

Audit system availability is verified as a precondition before high-risk executions
begin. A governance runtime that cannot verify the audit channel must not permit
execution above baseline risk thresholds.

:::doctrine
The hash chain provides tamper-evidence for the current implementation. Cryptographic
non-repudiation through HMAC signing of individual records is a planned capability
that adds stronger guarantees about record authorship. The hash chain is the current
structural requirement; HMAC signing is the future hardening step.

## Failure Mode

The most dangerous audit failure is not the complete absence of records — that is
visible and immediately actionable. The dangerous failure is the appearance of a
complete record that is not forensically defensible: records that exist but omit
the policy version that produced the decision, records that capture decisions but
not the tools invoked to implement them, records that document the outcome but not
the authority context that authorized it. Each omission individually degrades the
forensic value of the record. A record missing the policy version cannot support
decision replay. A record missing tool invocations cannot reconstruct the behavioral
trace. The Audit Integrity Protocol specifies the minimum complete record precisely
to define the threshold below which an audit record fails its forensic purpose.

:::constraint
A partial audit record is more dangerous than no audit record in one important
respect: it creates the appearance of governance documentation while failing to
support the forensic questions that documentation is supposed to answer. An
organization that discovers its audit records are incomplete after an incident
has both the incident and an audit failure to explain.

## Relationship to Principles and Constitution

The Audit Integrity Protocol directly implements [Principle 6 — Audit as Completion
Condition](/principles/principle-6): the ten required fields and the append-only,
hash-chained storage requirement operationalize what a complete audit record must
contain. It enforces [Constitutional Article VII — Auditability](/constitution/article-vii):
the tamper-evident, append-only audit record with hash-chaining is the architectural
specification for what the constitutional article requires. And it supports
[Constitutional Article III — Deterministic Enforcement](/constitution/article-iii):
the policy version field in every audit record is the mechanism by which the
determinism requirement can be verified — given the same policy version and the
same inputs, the same decision must be reproducible.
