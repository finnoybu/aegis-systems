*Persistence is not incidental. Only canonical export defines authoritative record.
Hidden retention violates constitutional integrity.*

## Principle

Memory in a governed AI system is not a passive byproduct of execution. It is a
governed resource — subject to the same explicit declaration, authority binding,
and audit requirements as any other action. AEGIS defines three memory layers:

1. **Ephemeral working context** — short-lived, non-authoritative working state that is not durable and may be discarded
2. **Structured session memory** — bounded contextual state within declared session scope, scoped to threat level and authority context
3. **Canonical export** — the durable, authoritative record; the only layer that defines what happened

Only canonical export is authoritative. A governance decision that exists in ephemeral
context but was never written to canonical export did not happen within the governance
record. An artifact produced during execution that was not canonically exported is
not a governed artifact — it is a side effect.

Hidden retention — persistence that occurs outside the declared memory architecture —
violates constitutional integrity. It is not a minor compliance gap. It is the creation
of an ungoverned record that exists outside the audit trail.

## Meaning

The distinction between ephemeral context, structured session memory, and canonical
export is not a technical implementation detail. It is a governance distinction.
Each layer has different authority requirements, different audit implications, and
different governance status.

Ephemeral context is working memory — the agent's ability to hold state within a
task. It is explicitly non-authoritative: nothing in ephemeral context is part of
the governance record. Structured session memory is bounded and scoped — it exists
within declared session boundaries and is governed by the authority context and
threat level of that session. It is not canonical, but it is constrained.

Canonical export is where governance responsibility concludes. It is the record of
what the task produced, under what authority, at what threat level, with what
constraint envelope. It is version-referenced, authority-bound, and audit-linked.
It is the only output of execution that carries constitutional status.

Hidden retention violates constitutional integrity because it creates persistence
outside this architecture — memory that was never declared, never scoped, never
authority-bound, and never audited. A system with hidden retention is a system
with a shadow record that the governance architecture cannot observe, evaluate,
or audit.

## In Practice

In a compliant AEGIS implementation, every artifact produced during execution is
labeled with its governance context before it is written: version reference, threat
posture, authority context, scope declaration, and constraint envelope. This labeling
is not metadata added after the fact — it is part of the artifact's canonical form.
An artifact without governance labeling is not a canonical artifact. It cannot be
referenced in subsequent governance decisions, cannot be included in the audit record,
and cannot be treated as an authoritative output of the execution.

Canonical export triggers an audit record entry. The connection between the artifact
and the governance decision that authorized its production is explicit in both the
artifact and the audit record. This bidirectional binding ensures that for any
canonical artifact, the governance context can be recovered, and for any governance
decision, the artifacts it authorized can be identified.

:::caution
Ephemeral context is explicitly non-authoritative. An agent that relies on ephemeral
context as the basis for subsequent decisions is operating on unverified, unaudited
state. Decisions that reference ephemeral context rather than canonical record are
governance decisions without an authoritative basis.

## Failure Mode

The failure mode of unstructured persistence is the emergence of an unofficial
record that supplements or supplants the official one. An agent that retains
information in ways not declared in the constraint envelope is an agent operating
with a memory architecture that governance cannot observe. This creates two risks:
the agent may act on retained information that was never authorized for the purpose
it is being used for; and the audit record becomes incomplete — it describes what
the governance layer authorized, but not what the agent actually had access to
when it made its proposals.

:::danger
Hidden retention violates constitutional integrity. A system that retains
information outside the declared memory architecture is not an AI system with
a supplemental memory — it is an AI system operating with ungoverned state.

## Relationship to Doctrine and Constitution

Structured Persistence operationalizes [Doctrine Article I — Constraint Before
Capability](/doctrine/article-i) in the memory domain: persistence must be declared
before it is exercised, just as capabilities must be declared before they are granted.
It directly grounds [Constitutional Article V — Information Sovereignty](/constitution/article-v):
the requirement that information access be a governed capability applies to retention
as much as to access — an agent that can retain information without governance
authorization has bypassed information sovereignty. And it supports [Constitutional
Article VII — Auditability](/constitution/article-vii): an audit record that does
not capture what was retained cannot reconstruct what the agent knew when it acted.
