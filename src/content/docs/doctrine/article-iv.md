title: Article IV — Oversight Before Autonomy
description: Autonomy is a risk multiplier — escalation to higher threat levels requires explicit justification and oversight approval
sidebar:
  order: 5
---

*Autonomy increases impact. Impact increases risk. Risk requires oversight.
Autonomy is therefore treated as a risk multiplier.*

## Doctrine

Autonomy is not a goal. It is a risk variable. The more autonomously an AI system
operates, the greater the potential impact of its decisions — and the greater the
potential impact of its failures. Oversight Before Autonomy establishes that as
autonomy increases, so does the oversight requirement. This is not a constraint on
capability. It is the correct allocation of decision authority between autonomous
systems and the humans who bear accountability for their outcomes.

Escalation to higher threat levels — where greater autonomy is permitted and
greater impact is possible — requires explicit justification, oversight approval,
a defined rollback strategy, and durable logging. At the highest threat level,
execution requires physical or network isolation and operator presence.[^4]

No system governed by AEGIS may self-authorize escalation.

## Meaning

The relationship between autonomy and risk is not linear — it compounds. A system
operating at a low threat level with constrained tool access can produce limited
harm if it behaves unexpectedly. A system operating at an elevated threat level with
access to production infrastructure, external APIs, and elevated authority can
produce significant, potentially irreversible harm from a single unexpected action.

Oversight Before Autonomy recognizes this asymmetry and requires that the oversight
intensity match it. Routine actions within defined parameters can be governed
autonomously. Actions with material operational impact, irreversible consequences,
or novel risk profiles require human authority. This is not a policy of distrust
toward AI systems — it is the correct structural response to the fact that the
humans who are accountable for outcomes must remain in a position to exercise
judgment about actions that could produce those outcomes.

The key word in this doctrine is *before*. Oversight must be established before
execution at elevated threat levels begins — not surfaced after the fact when
something goes wrong. A governance architecture that escalates autonomy first
and requests oversight review afterward has inverted the doctrine. Oversight is
the precondition for elevated execution, not the response to its failure.

## In Practice

The AEGIS threat level framework provides the operational structure for this
doctrine. At Threat Level 0 (Advisory) and Level 1 (Structured), autonomous
governance is sufficient. At Level 2 (Execution), bounded tool invocations with
defined rollback conditions may proceed within declared constraints. At Level 3
(External), interaction beyond the sandbox requires explicit escalation approval.
At Level 4 (Authority), dual-control approval and full traceability are mandatory.
At Level 5 (Detached Execution), physical or network isolation and operator
presence are required — no single party can authorize Level 5 execution.

Each escalation boundary requires an explicit request, a threat reclassification,
authority approval at the appropriate oversight level, isolation assessment,
constraint rebinding, and state dump. The governance runtime does not infer that
a situation warrants escalation. The agent must request it. A human authority must
approve it. The approval is logged. The constraint envelope for the elevated
execution is declared before execution begins.

:::caution
Autonomy at elevated threat levels is not a default that can be revoked if
something goes wrong. It is a governed grant that requires explicit establishment
before execution begins. The oversight requirement exists because the consequences
of failure at elevated levels are harder to reverse — not because they are more
likely.

## Failure Mode

A system that can self-authorize escalation is a system with no effective ceiling
on its operational authority. The failure mode is incremental and difficult to
observe until it has already occurred: a system that escalates slightly when the
situation seems to warrant it, then slightly more, each time self-determining that
its judgment about the situation is sufficient authorization. The practical result
is a system operating at threat levels and authority levels that its designers did
not intend and its operators cannot observe, having bypassed the oversight
boundaries that were designed to keep humans in meaningful control. Oversight
Before Autonomy is the doctrine that prevents this path from being available.

:::danger
No system governed by AEGIS may self-authorize escalation. Self-escalation is
not a governance shortcut. It is a constitutional violation.

## Relationship to Constitution

Oversight Before Autonomy is the doctrinal foundation of [Article IV — Human
Oversight](/constitution/article-iv) and [Article XI — Escalation Discipline](/constitution/article-xi).
Human Oversight establishes the constitutional requirement for escalation pathways
to human authority. Escalation Discipline establishes the procedural requirements
for how those pathways are used. Together they are the architectural enforcement
of this doctrine. The doctrine also grounds [Article III — Deterministic Enforcement](/constitution/article-iii):
the governance layer that prevents self-escalation must be architecturally external
to the system it governs — a system that controls its own governance layer can
always find a way to authorize what it wants to do.
